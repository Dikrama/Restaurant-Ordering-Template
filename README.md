# Restaurant-Ordering-Template
FMX Template for Online Restaurant Ordering

The purpose of creating this template is that you as a developer of the online ordering application already have the main application design with ready basic functionality. You just have to connect your backend to the application and configure the output of your content in the existing methods for outputting data to graphic controls using our styles. In addition, of course, there is an ability to implement independently the rest of the functionality, which is suitable exclusively for your restaurant.

The template consists of a DataModuls, 10 functional forms and the main form, which displays most of the functional forms inside it.

## Forms

When the application starts, the start form (`ufrmGetStarted`) is launched. It displays the name of your restaurant and basic contact information. Also to the right of the contact information, there are buttons that allow user to make a call from one of the available applications list. In addition, there is an ability to send an email to the mailing address of your restaurant using one of the proposed applications. At the bottom of the form there is a Get Started button. By clicking this button, you will be redirected to the main form (`ufrmMain`) of the application.

The main form of the application, at startup, immediately loads and displays the Dashboard form (`ufrmDashboard`). All forms loaded from the side menu of the main form or through the duplicate buttons of the Dashboard form are displayed on the pages of the `TTabControl` component. This allows you to use the main menu of the program on all forms where necessary. It also allows you to manage effectively open forms and transitions between them from one form through a single mechanism. The main method that is used to create forms, display their content on the `TTabControl` pages of the main form, as well as assign functionality to the controls of these forms, is performed in the `LoadScreenByName()` method. Study it and the methods called from it, and you will figure out how the logic for displaying forms in the application is built.

The forms implemented in this template:

* **GUI** ([screenshots](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Restaurant-Ordering-Template/tree/master/Documents))
  * **`ufrmMain`** - The Main Form
  * `ufrmCart` - Cart form
  * `ufrmCoupons` - Discount coupons form
  * `ufrmDashboard` - Dashboard form
  * `ufrmGallery` - Gallery form of restaurant
  * `ufrmGetStarted` - Welcome screen
  * `ufrmAboutUs` - About Us form
  * `ufrmMenu` - The form of detailed information about the selected dish from the Menu form
  * `ufrmAccount` - User account adding/editing form
  * `ufrmAddToCart` - form for adding/removing modifiers of the selected dish to/from the Menu
  * `ufrmOptionsList` - is a form that displays and allows the client to select additional dish modifiers (additives). Such as sauce, mustard, etc.
* **ORM**
  * `uDMUnit`

## Usage

Now, we will analyze in more detail how the work with the application data is organized. In addition, we will consider methods for outputting data to Listbox and other graphic elements of application forms.
Application test data, for an example, is implemented using the TFDMemTable component. In this case, the list of fields is not limited, and you do not need to use exactly this component in your project. Any TQuery or TDataSet should be fine. This version of the template assumes the ability to run the application on any platform.

In the applicationâ€™s `uDMUnit` data module, a number of methods have been created that are necessary only to populate the `TFDMemTable` components with test data. You will not need these methods and you will delete them. Nevertheless, during studying our template, they will help you visually understand what data and what type of data you will need to receive from your backend or you can choose from your database in order to use it in the template.  So that the template will work correctly with the data that you submitted.

Styles of all the components that are presented in StyleBook on the main form of the frmMain template can be changed as you wish. Therefore, if necessary, or if you need to display additional data in a particular component, you can easily remake existing styles and prepare the application for your needs.

In order for your data, rather than the test data, to be displayed on the `TListBox` visual elements, you need to upload your data to the `TFDMemTable` located on a data module or make changes to the method of filling it when the data module is initialized (implementing your methods of receiving data from the backend or from the database). The following are all the methods that populate `TFDMemTables` with the test data at application startup:

* `InsertTestDataForTheMenu ();`
* `InsertTestDataForTheCoupons ();`
* `InsertTestDataForTheGallery ();`
* `InsertTestDataForTheOptions ();`
* `InsertTestDataForAboutUs ();`
* `InsertTestDataForContactInfo ();`

From the name of the methods, it is clear which one is responsible for filling out one form or another with the test data. Having studied any of the methods, it becomes clear which of `TFDMemTable` is used for which form. * * 
* `MenuListTable` - using in the ufrmMenu and ufrmCart forms
* `CouponsListTable` - using in the ufrmCoupons form
* `GalleryListTable` - using in the ufrmGallery form
* `OptionsListTable` - using in the ufrmOptionsList and ufrmAddToCart forms
* `AboutUsTable` - using in the ufrmAboutUs and ufrmGetStarted forms
* `AboutUsDesciptionTable` - using in the ufrmAboutUs and ufrmGetStarted forms

In order to add images to `TFDMemTables`, use `TImageLists` with images already loaded in them. This is done in order to demonstrate how to load an image into the components of the `TQuery` family, and to show how to load images from fields of type `TBlob` into the elements of graphic controls on the form. Such, for example, as `TListBox`.

Loading data from `TFDMemTables` into graphic control elements is implemented on each form separately. A list of method names is given below:

* `TfrmAboutUs.BuildAboutUsInfo ();`
* `TfrmAboutUs.BuildContsctInfoList ();`
* `TfrmAddToCart.BuildForm ();`
* `TfrmAddToCart.BuildOptionsList ();`
* `TfrmCart.BuildCartList ();`
* `TfrmCoupons.LoadCouponsList ();`
* `TfrmGallery.LoadGalleryList ();`
* `TfrmGetStarted.ShowInfoAboutRestaurant ();`
* `TfrmGetStarted.BuildContsctInfoList ();`
* `TfrmMenu.LoadMenuList ();`
* `TfrmOptionsList.BuildOptionsList ();`

The shopping cart is implemented using an array of records, presented as a `TCartList` class. Dishes and their modifiers are added to this array with one or another type of `TCartItemType`. And the connection between the dish and the modifiers is organized through the parameters `Index`, `OwnerIndex` of the `TCartList` class.

For the convenience of working with the cart, several methods are implemented:

* `AddItemToCart(`
    * `aItemId: int64 = 0;`
    * `aOwnerID: int64 = 0;`
    * `const aItemName: string = '';`
    * `aItemType: TCartItemType = citItem;`
    * `aQuantity: Extended = 1;`
    * `aItemPrice: Extended = 0;`
    * `aOwnerIndex: Integer = -1): Integer;`
* `DelItemFromCart(aItemIndex: Integer = 0);
ClearCart();`
* `GetCartTotalAmount(): Extended;`

In any case, you can change these methods as you like, or write your own methods for filling out forms and their visual components with the data. The methods given in the template only show how filling the data of the template forms visual elements is implemented, as well as the editing of this data. The methods above provide ways for assigning click processing methods to TlistBoxItems or buttons located inside TlistBoxItems. After analyzing these methods, you will notice that the Tag property is used to transfer the identifiers of the record or item.

## Graphical Elements

Each of the templates in the current implementation represents only stylistic, graphic and animation effects. And the test data is presented only for understanding the processes of filling graphic elements of forms.

Icons of graphic elements used in the templates are taken from the resource:
